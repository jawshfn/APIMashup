    <h1>Video Game Search and Weather Forecast Mashup</h1>
    <p>This web app allows users to search for video games using the RAWG API and view details about the games, including: release date, 
        rating, available store to purchase from, and an image. The user is then able to sort the list of games by rating from either high to low, or low to high. 
        The app also displays the current weather forecast for a user-specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API, including temperature, weather description, 
        wind speed, and an associated weather icon. This application is used to check the weather and if the weather is bad the user can easily search for games
        to play on that disgusting rainy day!</p>
